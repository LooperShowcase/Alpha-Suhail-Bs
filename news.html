      Real Madrid have already
       signed their star of the future up front, with Los Blancos
        investing up to â‚¬60m in 16-year-old Brazilian Endrick Felipe. 
        The talented teenager has come under pressure of late for his scoring drought at Palmeiras
    </p>
    <p>  
    Real Madrid have been greeted with some positive news on the injury
       front as goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is expected to be fit and ready for the upcoming La Liga clash against Real Valladolid.</p>
    </p>
    <p>The 37-year-old's contract expires in the summer and terms over a new deal have not yet been 
      agreed with Los Blancos.
      With no agreement yet in place, Modric has been tipped to
       make a big-money move to the Saudi Pro League
       later this year, potentially reuniting with former
       teammate Cristiano Ronaldo.
